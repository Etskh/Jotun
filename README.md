Jotun 0.0.0-x (Ymir)
=====

A redux of a module-based framework that compiles on Linux ( tested on Ubuntu ), and MacOSX (tested on Mountain Lion), and probably Windows ( untested, but I'm a Windows programmer, so it's a good guess). Plans to support mobile aren't being developed, but isn't not on my mind.

##Building
For just testing the framework, I've not bothered to make the executable a different project (yet) so everything just builds into an executable in one step. It uses the SCons build tool - but just one file, and to compensate for not having SConscript files scattered through the source, there is a lot of python (relatively) in the SConstruct file. A simple build can obviouly be invoked by:
```
scons
```
...but that will build everything. Terrible. I've made three types of builds: `debug` which has debug symbols, the DEBUG define, and no optimisation; `profile` which is a more lean version of the debug build; and `release` which does heavy code optimisation and strips unneeded symbols. Each build can be invoked by adding `target=[build]` to the end of the scons command, where build is one of: debug, profile, or release. We can also add all the scons flags we want.
```
scons -Q -j4 target=debug
```
That will build it lightening fast - and only the debug. To run it, right now, you need to invoke the run manually. Hopefully it won't be the case for <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Etskh/Jotun/issues/2">the future</a>.


##Systems
The main driving agent of the modules is the systems. Each system is created for a specific Application class. Every application can only have one system per type of system.

###Gfx
The Gfx system needs a `Device::Handle` to initialize. It's the window, effectively. Some work will need to go into making it less dependant on the physical window, and more on the graphics device. So if a designer wants a secondary window, it wouldn't need a whole new openGL context (and the resources could be shared).

The Gfx is simply an interface for Scenes which then in turn, create SceneNodes. These scene-nodes are filled up and maintained by the driver code - and managed by the SceneGraph. The drivers ask for their own `Mesh::Handle`s and `Material::Handle`s through the Mesh and Material interfaces. The sceneNodes take these and create `MeshContext::Handle`s and `MaterialContext::Handle`s - and these are what the graphics loop will manage and iterate over.


###GUI
The GUI uses an attribute-based system that is even more loose than something that is checked at compile-time like other template-systems. This is so it is very flexible, debuggable, and scriptable. The goal here was to create a GUI interface that was robust and powerful, but could get something showing with little code. 

##Core
I've been working on this core library for some time. Most of the cooler stuff in there (like aligned, templatised strings) is hidden away basically without commentsâ€¦ but I hope to rectify that soon.


##Naming
The project is named after something that sounded cool, I'll be perfectly honest. The fact is frost giants are awesome, and most of this code was fueled by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjRUee5S44w">Amon Amarth</a>. The first incarnation is obviously named <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ymir">Ymir</a>. The following is a breakdown of the naming convention for versioning.

**Major version**
 - Changes every-time there is a major restructure of code (adding or removing a system, or collapsing one system into others).
 - Major version releases can be named
 - It stays low

**Minor version**
 - Changes every-time there is an API change. Developers will need to consider the implications of the upgrade, but usually don't need to do much
 - It can climb pretty high
 - Resets when the major version ticks up

**Release version**
 - Changes every time there is an implementation change of a release candidate that changes the inner-functionality
 - This doesn't cover small changes like buffer-overflow corrections; small fixes that don't change a large portion of code are not considered to be "release" version upgrades
 - Shouldn't affect the developers heavily
 - Might reduce CPU, memory usage, or disk reads
 - Could add support (invisibly) for other OS
 - Could add support (invisibly) for other build systems
 - It can climb super high
 - Resets when the minor version ticks up

**Build version**
 - Changes every time there has been a commit into the suppository
 - It effectively has no implications for the Developer
 - Resets when the minor version goes up
 - If the build version accumulates, it will not be released
 - Lets the Developers know how much the product has changed (if the project has good commits)


Given, `1.2.3-23 Ymir`, from this example, we can infer the following things:
 - One large restructure of code
 - Since then, two API changes
 - and since then, three implementation differences
 - those five API and implementations on 23 different commits/issues
 - And it's called Ymir because we know how to party
